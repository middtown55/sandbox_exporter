    "# Sandbox Exporter Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "The [sandbox_exporter](https://github.com/usdot-its-jpo-data-portal/sandbox_exporter) package allows users to load, query, and export data from ITS DataHub's sandbox efficiently by providing a wrapper around the s3select package and providing additional functionality for interacting with the ITS DataHub data. This notebook contains short instructions and sample code for how to use this tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the script by cloning the module's [code repository on GitHub](https://github.com/usdot-its-jpo-data-portal/wzdx_sandbox). You can do so by running one of the following in command line. If unfamiliar with how to clone a repository, follow the [official GitHub guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository).\n",
    "    - via HTTP: `git clone https://github.com/usdot-its-jpo-data-portal/sandbox_exporter.git`\n",
    "    - via SSH (if using 2-factor authentication): `git clone git@github.com:usdot-its-jpo-data-portal/sandbox_exporter.git`\n",
    "2. Navigate into the repository folder by entering `cd sandbox_exporter` in command line.\n",
    "3. Run `pip install -e .` to install the sandbox_exporter Python package.\n",
    "4. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use cases\n",
    "- Users can now pass a list of fields into the function and get back only those fields\n",
    "- Users have the following output format options: \n",
    "  - return object array\n",
    "  - object generator\n",
    "  - write to csv file\n",
    "  - write to newline json file\n",
    "- User have the option to turn off print statements (added verbose flag)\n",
    "- Now uses S3 Select to query the data, which is more speed and cost-efficient\n",
    "- Utilizing a package that is also able to show the estimated cost associated with each query"
